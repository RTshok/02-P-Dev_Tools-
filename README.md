## 1HW
The folder named *1HW* contains program that sorts the arrays(using insertion sort) and gets the time of sorting.
Input of that program are name of file, and amount of arrays to sort.
The output is a file,with time of sorting and amount of sorted elements.
The arrays are randomly generated.
You can compile the program using *Makefile*
The plot built in *GNUPLOT*,on that graph we can practicaly see the complexity of insertion sort algorithm.(I used different flags to compile)
The complexity is O(N^2).

##Additional1HW
That folder has program which compute the smallest possible multipliers from the number.That algorithm called 'Prime Factorization'.
Input are *Amount of arrays to sort*, *The number which configure the size of elements in array* *Name of File*.
Output is the file with time, and amount of elements which was computed.
Also use *Makefile* to compile.
The plot built in *GNUPLOT*,on that graph we can practicaly see the complexity of prime factorization program.(I used different flags to compile)
The complexity is O(N).
